# Solo Website Workshop  

Welcome to your very first project after finishing the tutorial ðŸŽ‰  

Youâ€™ll be building a website inspired by the [Frontend Practice Starbucks Project](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/starbucks). This is a chance to practice your HTML and CSS skills, and apply everything youâ€™ve learned so far.  

ðŸ‘‰ Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions in your class channel â€” no question is too small!

## Instructions  

1. **Start with the files**  
   - Open the project folder.  
   - Youâ€™ll be working mainly in `page.html` and `style.css`.  
   - All the images and resources you need are in the `assets` folder.  

2. **Build the structure**  
   - Create the basic layout of the website in `page.html`.  
   - Use semantic HTML (`header`, `section`, `footer`, etc.) to organize your page.  

3. **Style the website**  
   - In `style.css`, add styles to make your website look like the reference design.  
   - Focus on layout first (boxes, sections, grids, flexbox), then add colors, fonts, and spacing.  

4. **Divide the page into sections**  
   The website can be broken into these parts (see the image in `image-instructions/website-divided-by-sections.png`):  
   - Header (navigation + logo)  
   - Section 1 (hero area)  
   - Section 2 (featured product/offer)  
   - Section 3 (another product/info section)  
   - Footer (links, contact, etc.)  

   Tackle them one at a time.  

5. **Test your work**  
   - Open `page.html` in your browser to see your progress.  
   - Keep checking after every small change â€” this helps you debug and learn faster.

## Tips  

- **Donâ€™t try to make it perfect immediately.** Focus on getting the sections in place first. You can polish details later.  
- **Google is your friend.** If youâ€™re stuck on a CSS property, look it up!  
- **Ask questions in the class channel.** Chances are, others are facing the same issue.

## Goal  

By the end of this exercise, youâ€™ll have recreated the Starbucks page layout in your own code. ðŸŽ¯  

This is your first big step into building real websites on your own â€” have fun with it and donâ€™t worry if it doesnâ€™t look 100% identical. The goal is **practice** and **confidence**.
